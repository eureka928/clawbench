# Scenario: Team Standup + Sprint Planning
#
# Inspired by: OpenClaw showcase — coordinating dev teams from mobile,
# turning Slack chatter into structured sprint updates.
#
# Real-world problem: You're the PM. It's 8:55am. Standup is in 5 minutes.
# You haven't checked Slack since yesterday. You need to know: what shipped,
# what's blocked, who needs help, and what the sprint burn looks like —
# synthesized from scattered Slack messages and the task board.
#
# Complexity:
#   - 25 Slack messages across 3 channels (general, engineering, random)
#   - 15 sprint tasks in various states
#   - Must correlate: Slack updates ↔ task board status
#   - Must detect: blockers, risks, scope creep, mismatched status
#   - Must identify: someone said "done" in Slack but task is still "in_progress"
#   - Must produce: structured standup prep + recommended talking points
#   - Calendar context: what's the sprint timeline? any upcoming deadlines?

prompt: >
  It's 8:55am, standup is in 5 minutes. Catch me up: what happened
  yesterday on the team, what's the sprint status, who's blocked, and
  what should I raise in standup? Cross-reference Slack with the task
  board — flag anything inconsistent.
