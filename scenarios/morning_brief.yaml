# Scenario: Morning Command Center
#
# Inspired by: OpenClaw showcase — daily brief merging calendar + inbox +
# tasks + weather into a single "operating picture" message.
#
# Real-world problem: You wake up and need to know what matters TODAY —
# conflicts, urgent emails, overdue tasks, prep needed — in 90 seconds,
# not 20 minutes of checking 4 apps.
#
# Complexity:
#   - 10 calendar events (2 conflicts, 1 needs prep, 1 offsite)
#   - 15 inbox messages (3 urgent, mix of newsletters/threads/action items)
#   - 12 tasks (2 overdue, 4 due today, blocked items)
#   - Must synthesize across sources (email about meeting prep, task for same meeting)
#   - Must detect calendar conflict and propose resolution
#   - Must prioritize ruthlessly — 90-second brief, not info dump
#   - Must propose timeblocked schedule with approval gate

prompt: >
  It's 6:30am on Thursday Feb 6. Give me my daily brief: what matters today,
  what conflicts I have, what needs prep, and what can slip. Then propose a
  timeblocked schedule for my day. Don't change anything without my approval.
