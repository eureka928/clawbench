# Current Priorities

## This Week (Feb 10-14)
- Incident postmortem for Saturday outage (INC-2026-0042) — due before 2pm all-hands Monday
- Sprint 14 planning (include incident remediation tasks)
- Auth migration validation continues
- Dashboard V2 design specs in progress

## Standing Rules
- Never send emails on my behalf without explicit approval
- Client escalations take priority over internal meetings
- Always loop in Sarah Kim on P0 incidents
- Incident postmortems must be blameless — focus on systems, not individuals
- Revenue impact numbers are CONFIDENTIAL — do not include in public postmortems
- Postmortem should include: timeline, root cause, impact, action items, prevention
