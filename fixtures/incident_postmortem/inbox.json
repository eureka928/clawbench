    "body": "Alex, here are my on-call notes from the outage:\n\n2:03 AM — PagerDuty alert fires. API gateway 503 errors spiking.\n2:10 AM — I check metrics. DB connection pool at 100% utilization. All connections exhausted.\n2:25 AM — Restarted API pods (no effect — connections immediately re-saturated).\n2:45 AM — Escalated to Marcus. Tried increasing pool size but hit the managed DB max (100 connections).\n3:15 AM — Marcus joins. Suspects caching layer is holding connections open.\n4:30 AM — Marcus adds caching layer instrumentation. Caching looks fine actually.\n5:00 AM — I notice the auto-scaling deploy from Friday at 5pm doubled our pod count (8 -> 16). Each pod opens 10 connections. 16 x 10 = 160. But our DB pool limit is 100.\n5:15 AM — We scale pods back to 8. Connections drop to 80/100.\n5:30 AM — Services recovering but some requests still failing due to stale connection state.\n7:00 AM — Full restart of all pods with correct connection limits.\n10:14 AM — All services confirmed healthy. Incident resolved.\n\nThe Friday deploy was an auto-scaling config change (PR #412) that doubled the pod count for the weekend traffic spike, but nobody updated the DB connection pool limit. — Tom",

    "body": "Alex, here's what I found:\n\nI initially thought it was the caching layer holding DB connections open (that's what I told Tom at 3:15 AM). After instrumenting the cache, the connection patterns looked normal.\n\nTom actually found the real cause around 5 AM — the Friday auto-scaling deploy (PR #412) doubled pods from 8 to 16 but the DB connection pool was still at 100 max. With 16 pods x 10 connections each = 160 needed, but only 100 available.\n\nMy initial diagnosis was wrong. The caching layer is fine. The real issue is that our auto-scaling doesn't account for DB connection limits.\n\nI want to flag: we had a VERY similar issue in November (INC-2025-0089). The action item from that postmortem was to create a connection pool scaling policy. It never got done — it's still sitting in the backlog.\n\n— Marcus",

I didn't realize there was a connection pool dependency — our deploy checklist doesn't include a DB connection limit check.\n\nHappy to help with whatever remediation is needed. Should we add a connection limit check to the deploy pipeline?\n\n— James",
