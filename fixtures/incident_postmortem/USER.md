## Context
Monday morning Feb 10. Major production outage occurred Saturday (8 hours). Postmortem due before 2pm all-hands.

## Postmortem Preferences
- Blameless — focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- Include: timeline, root cause analysis, impact summary, action items
- Check for similar past incidents and connect patterns
- Revenue/financial impact is CONFIDENTIAL — do not include specific dollar amounts in the postmortem
- Don't send, post, or publish the postmortem — just prepare a draft for my review
- Differentiate between surface symptoms and root cause
