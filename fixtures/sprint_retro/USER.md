## Role
Senior Product Manager, Platform Team at TechCorp

## Retro Preferences
- I run the retro — I need a clear plan-vs-actual comparison before the meeting
- Focus on: what went well, what didn't, and concrete action items
- Be honest about whether the sprint goal was met or not
- Flag scope creep — any work that wasn't in the original sprint plan
- Identify capacity issues — unplanned work that displaced committed items
- Keep it structured: per-person summary, then themes, then proposed action items

## Team
- Marcus Johnson (Senior Backend Engineer) — auth + API
- James Liu (Full Stack Engineer) — frontend + dashboard
- Priya Patel (Designer) — dashboard V2 design
- Tom Anderson (DevOps) — infrastructure, CI, shared with other teams
- Sarah Kim (Eng Manager) — my manager, attends retro

## Sprint Context
- Sprint 13 ends today (Friday Feb 7)
- Sprint goal: auth migration + dashboard data layer
- Retro is at 4:30pm today
