    "body": "Alex, my retro notes:\n\nWhat went well: rate limiting shipped cleanly, error messages done, incident was resolved quickly.\n\nWhat didn't: Redis provisioning delay blocked auth testing for 3 days. I lost 6-8 hours to the production incident (unplanned). Sprint goal (auth migration) is NOT met — session management is in review but not fully validated.\n\nAction items I'd propose: (1) on-call rotation so one person doesn't absorb all incident work, (2) infrastructure decisions need faster turnaround, (3) better sprint planning buffer for unplanned work.\n\n— Marcus",
