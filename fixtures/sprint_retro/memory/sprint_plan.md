# Sprint 13 Plan (Jan 27 — Feb 7)

## Sprint Goal
Ship auth migration (session management + error messages) and complete dashboard data layer refactor.

## Committed Items
1. TC-880 — Auth migration: session management refactor (Marcus, critical)
2. TC-891 — Rate limiting for public API (Marcus, high)
3. TC-903 — Fix timezone bug in scheduler (James, high)
4. TC-912 — Auth error messages update (Marcus, medium)
5. TC-885 — Dashboard data layer refactor (James, high)
6. TC-920 — Redis cluster provisioning (Tom, critical — dependency for TC-880)
7. TC-925 — Dashboard V2 design mockups (Priya, medium)
8. TC-931 — Incident postmortem writeup (Marcus, medium — added mid-sprint)

## NOT in Sprint Plan
- TC-935 (GraphQL prototype) — NOT committed, James's personal initiative
- TC-930 (Caching layer investigation) — added after Wed night incident

## Capacity
- Marcus: full sprint
- James: full sprint
- Tom: 50% (shared with DevOps on-call)
- Priya: full sprint

## Risks Identified at Planning
- Auth migration depends on Redis provisioning (infrastructure)
- Dashboard refactor is large — could carry over
- Marcus vacation in Sprint 14 reduces capacity

## Velocity (last 3 sprints)
- Sprint 10: 12 points
- Sprint 11: 10 points
- Sprint 12: 14 points
