# Current Priorities

## This Week (Feb 10-14)
- Dashboard V2 launch readiness assessment (due Wednesday)
- P1 bug resolution (TC-990 export bug)
- Performance benchmark validation (production-scale)
- Marketing copy accuracy review
- Support team briefing preparation
- Incident remediation tasks from Saturday outage

## Standing Rules
- Never send emails on my behalf without explicit approval
- Client escalations take priority over internal meetings
- Always loop in Sarah Kim on P0 incidents
- Revenue projections are CONFIDENTIAL — do not share outside exec team
- Launch decisions require David Park's sign-off
- Better to delay than launch with known P1 bugs or inaccurate marketing
