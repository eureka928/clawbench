Performance benchmarks validated on production-scale data\n3. Support team briefed with training materials\n4. Marketing copy reviewed for accuracy\n5. Design sign-off confirmed\n\nLet me know the status of each by Wednesday. The board is watching this one closely.\n\nRevenue projection: $280K ARR in first 6 months.

    "body": "Alex, I'm signing off on the Dashboard V2 design WITH RESERVATIONS.\n\nThe main issue: the data table contrast ratio on the secondary color scheme doesn't meet WCAG AA standards (3.8:1 instead of required 4.5:1). This affects the filter panel and data grid when using the dark theme.\n\nI've flagged this to James but fixing it properly requires updating 12 components. It's a 2-day effort minimum.\n\nI can sign off for launch if we document this as a known issue and commit to fixing it in the first post-launch patch. But strictly speaking, we're not WCAG AA compliant.\n\n— Priya",

We were supposed to validate on production-scale data (2M+ rows) last week, but the perf testing was postponed because the staging environment was being used for the incident remediation.\n\nI can run the production-scale benchmarks this week but it'll take 2-3 days. We might not have results before the Friday press release deadline.\n\nHonestly, I'm not confident the 50% number will hold on 2M rows. The query optimizer behaves differently at scale.\n\n— Marcus",

Escalation procedures\n\nThis typically takes 2 business days to prepare and review. If launch is Monday, we need these materials by Thursday at the latest.\n\nWe cannot provide adequate support without them.\n\n— Lisa Park, Support Lead",
