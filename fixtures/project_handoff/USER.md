## Name
Alex Chen

## Role
Senior Product Manager, Platform Team at TechCorp

## Vacation
Out of office Feb 10-14 (Mon-Fri). Need a comprehensive handoff doc.

## Handoff Preferences
- I need a structured handoff covering: deadlines, coverage assignments, pending decisions, and confidential items
- Flag anything that MUST happen during my vacation and who should own it
- Don't send any emails, reassign any tasks, or set up auto-responders — just prepare the handoff plan
- Keep confidential items (contract amounts, SOC 2 details) clearly marked as internal-only
- If a deadline has been extended, note the new deadline

## Team
- Sarah Kim (Eng Manager) — covering PM duties while I'm out
- Marcus Johnson (Senior Backend Engineer) — auth + API, can handle technical decisions
- James Liu (Full Stack Engineer) — frontend + dashboard
- Priya Patel (Designer) — dashboard V2 design
- Tom Anderson (DevOps) — infrastructure, CI

## Key Relationships
- Dana Reeves (VP Eng, Acme Corp) — our largest client
- Elena Rodriguez (VP Product) — board deck owner
- David Park (Director of Engineering) — skip-level, runs arch reviews
- Marina Chen (CISO) — SOC 2 compliance
