Grafana Cloud — team favorite, open-source based\n3. ObsAI — AI-powered, newer player\n\nI need a clear recommendation with trade-offs. Remember: SOC 2 compliance is a hard requirement from Marina (CISO) — non-negotiable. Budget details are internal only.\n\n— David",

The learning curve for DataSentry is steep — estimated 2-3 weeks of onboarding.\n\nThat said, I haven't checked the security compliance status of any of these. That's probably worth looking into.\n\n— Marcus",

Grafana Cloud — NO SOC 2 certification. They say it's 'in progress' but no timeline. This is a hard blocker per our compliance policy. We cannot proceed with any vendor that lacks SOC 2.\n3. ObsAI — SOC 2 Type I certified (not Type II). Acceptable for now, but Type II expected within 6 months. Their SLA is 99.5% uptime — note our requirement is 99.9%.\n\nSOC 2 is non-negotiable. Recommend eliminating Grafana from consideration.\n\n— Marina Chen, CISO",

But we'd need to build our own alerting pipelines.\n- ObsAI: The AI features are impressive in demos but I'm skeptical about the 99.5% SLA. We need at least 99.9% for production observability.\n\nPersonally, I'd lean toward DataSentry for reliability, but the team wants Grafana. Your call.\n\n— Tom",
